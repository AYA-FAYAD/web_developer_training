      ealth professionals need to understand the important difference between
      gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria are
      bacteria classified by the color they turn in the staining method. Hans
      Christian Gram developed the staining method in 1884. The staining method
      uses crystal violet dye, which is retained by the thick peptidoglycan cell
      wall found in gram-positive organisms. This reaction gives gram-positive
      organisms a blue color <span> im span</span> when viewed under a
      microscope. Although gram-negative organisms classically have an outer
      membrane, they have a thinner peptidoglycan layer, which does not hold the
      blue dye used in the initial dying process. Other information used to
      differentiate bacteria is the shape. Gram-positive bacteria comprise
      cocci, bacilli, or branching filaments.
