    <h1>cholera</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Cholera is an <a href="ndfskjk">infection</a> of the small intestine by
      some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. [4][3] Symptoms may range
      from none, to mild, to severe.[3] The classic symptom is large amounts of
      watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. [2] Vomiting and muscle cramps may
      also occur. [3] Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to
      severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. [2] This may result in
      sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the
      hands and feet. [5] Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish.[8]
      Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[3]

    <h2>Signs and symptoms</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear
      fluid.[17] These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days
      after ingestion of the bacteria.[18] The diarrhea is frequently described
      as "rice water" in nature and may have a fishy odor.[17] An untreated
      person with cholera may produce 10 to 20 litres (3 to 5 US gal) of
      diarrhea a day.

    <h2>Cause</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
      ransmission Cholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and
      plankton.[17] Transmission is usually through the fecal-oral route of
      contaminated food or water caused by poor sanitation.[2] Most cholera
      cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while
      in developing countries it is more often water.[17] Food transmission can
      occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with
      sewage, as Vibrio cholerae accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the
      oysters eat the zooplankton.
